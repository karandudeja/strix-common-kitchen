            <li class="my-4">It is your responsibility to check the Cleaning-Card üìë, on your or one of the top shelf-doors, for guidelines and your responsibility in the shared corridor kitchen </li>
            <li class="my-4">Please <b>clean the kitchen floor</b>, with a broom and the wet cleaning mop, when the floor is dirty during your kitchen duty week. Please include also cleaning the under kitchen-sink area, when cleaning the floor. Please <b>clean the floor at least once</b>, before your duty ends.</li>
            <li class="my-4">Please <b>clean up ALL of the recycling items/boxes</b>, and take them to the recycling room, even if the white boxes are less filled, so that nothing rots in them for the next 7 days. If possible, wipe these boxes clean, on the inside in the recycling room and you will improve hygiene levels for all of us. üôÇ</li>
            <li class="my-4">Please <b>clean up all the food waste bins, under the cleaning sink</b> (or the wash basin), and throw the garbage bags in the food waste disposal area outside SSSB Strix, Armegatan 32A.</li>
            <li class="my-4">If the <b>waste bins, or recycling boxes are getting filled fast, during your duty week</b> ; then it is your responsibility to empty them in the correct manner, and ensure the kitchen stays clean.</li>
            <li class="my-4">Please <b>add or replace the bins, with fresh/new garbage collection polythene bags and the brown bags</b> near the corner TV üì∫, so that the garbage bins are NOT empty like this üóëÔ∏èü™£ üö´üò£, but have a polythene/paper bag to drop food waste in. This will also be a courtesy to the next person using the kitchen. The polythene garbage bags are available at all major stores, like Lidl, ICA, Coop, Rusta etc. You can also change the wiping cloth if you are extra nice üôÇ</li>
            <li class="my-4">Please <b>wipe the inside + outside of the microwave</b> for clean warming and better food hygiene.</li>
            <li class="my-4">Please <b>clean the corridor floor</b> with a broom. This is the area from the elevator in the middle of the building, till our corridor end. This has been a request from the SSSB caretakers.</li>
            <li class="my-4">It is only after you complete the above tasks, transfer the Cleaning-Card üìë to the next person's top shelf-door, for their duty, coming Monday onwards.<span class="text-neutral-500"> The next person is usually, to the right of your shelf, or 'your room number+1'. Unless you stay in 1221, then it is 1224 or if you are in 1229 then it is 1216</span></li>

            <li class="my-3">Please complete all the duties mentioned -  <b>because if you only do 5 out of 9 tasks</b> as mentioned in the duties, the other corridor folks will see that, and next time, they will also not want to do a complete job when it is their duty.
                They might think, <i>"Why should I do a good job, when the other person did not do their cleaning properly?"</i> Such thoughts gradually impact all of us, and it makes
                the kitchen dirty and dirtier. So, please do all the duties mentioned.</li>
            <li class="my-3">Complete all the cleaning tasks, within your cleaning period, your week.</li>
            <li class="my-3">If you are not going to be available, in the week of your cleaning duty, then please inform in the WhatsApp group and swap with someone else.</li>
            <li class="my-3">Please behave like a civilised adult, who is willing to participate and is supportive of the shared reponsibilities. You are most likely above 18 yrs, literate and are studying in a half-decent university college in one of the best cities in Europe!</li>
